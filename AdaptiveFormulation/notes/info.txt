Λ(x,y;λ)=f(x,y)+λg(x,y)


1. Construct the Lagrange multiplier augmented function

for them,
f(x, y) = x + y, they want to maximize this.
g(x,y)=x^2+y^2−1=0, which is the constraint function.
Since g(x,y)=0, we are not really changing the original function, provided that the constraint is met!


for us,


A(x,y; lambda) =   f(x,y) + lambda * g(x,y)

f(x, y) = summation( T/p_i * v(p))
g(x, y) = -(alpha + beta * sum(s_i/p_i) - rate * T)^2
